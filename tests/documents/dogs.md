# Dogs
Dogs have been humanity’s loyal companions for thousands of years, with evidence suggesting domestication began over 15,000 years ago. They are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and ability to form strong emotional bonds with humans. There are hundreds of dog breeds, ranging from tiny Chihuahuas to massive Great Danes, each with unique traits and temperaments. Dogs serve in various roles, including service animals for people with disabilities, therapy dogs in hospitals, and working dogs in law enforcement and search-and-rescue missions. Their keen sense of smell makes them invaluable in detecting drugs, explosives, and even certain diseases like cancer. Regular exercise and mental stimulation are essential for a dog’s well-being, helping prevent behavioral issues. A balanced diet tailored to their age, size, and activity level supports their health and longevity. Training and socialization from an early age help dogs become well-adjusted members of society. Many cultures view dogs as symbols of fidelity, protection, and unconditional love. Above all, dogs enrich human lives with joy, comfort, and a reminder of the simple pleasures in life.
