# Cats
Cats are beloved domestic animals known for their independence, grace, and playful nature. They have been companions to humans for thousands of years, with ancient Egyptians among the first cultures to worship them. Cats possess sharp senses, including excellent night vision and acute hearing, which make them skilled hunters. Their retractable claws allow them to climb trees and grip prey with precision. Despite their reputation for being aloof, cats form strong bonds with their owners and often show affection through purring and head-butting. A cat's typical lifespan ranges from 12 to 18 years, though some live into their early twenties with proper care. There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, varying in size, coat color, and temperament. Cats communicate using a mix of vocalizations—meows, purrs, and hisses—as well as body language like tail position and ear movement. Regular grooming helps keep their coats healthy and reduces hairballs. Whether lounging on a sunny windowsill or chasing a toy mouse, cats continue to captivate people around the world with their charm and mystery.
