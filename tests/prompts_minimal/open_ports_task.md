**Task:**

Write a Python script that identifies and lists all open network ports on a specified machine. The script should output the following information for each port: process ID, process name, and the list of open ports. The script should handle different network configurations and edge cases (e.g., unreachable IP addresses, non-integer port numbers). Additionally, include error handling and log specific details when issues arise. The output should be formatted clearly for readability.

**Context:**

This task is relevant for network administrators or cybersecurity professionals who need to monitor and analyze system activity through port scanning. The script can help in identifying suspicious activities, detecting potential vulnerabilities, or ensuring system security.

**Structure:**

- **Input:** Provide the machine's IP address or hostname.
- **Output:** A list of open ports with corresponding process ID, process name, and port numbers. Include error messages if the machine cannot be reached or ports are not integers.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure port numbers are integers and handle cases where they are not valid.
  - Log any exceptions or errors encountered during the scan.
- **Additional Functionalities:**
  - Consider adding a GUI for user-friendly interaction.
  - Optionally, provide alerts or notifications for suspicious activities.

**Examples:**

- **Sample Input:** `192.168.1.1`
- **Sample Output:**
  ```
  Process ID: 1234
  Process Name: web_server.py
  Open Ports:
    - 80
    - 443

  Process ID: 5678
  Process Name: file_manager.py
  Open Ports:
    - 20
  ```

- **Error Handling Example:**
  ```
  Error: Machine unreachable or failed to connect on port 80.
  Suggested Fix: Verify the IP address and check network permissions.
  ```

**Depth:**

- The script should be able to handle multiple machines in case of a scan.
- Include comments for clarity and organization.
- Optimize port scanning to avoid overwhelming the system.

**When to Stop Development:**

- If minor issues are resolved without further complications.
- If additional functionalities or error handling do not meet initial requirements.

**Logs:**

- Include detailed logs of all attempts and successful scans.
- Log any exceptions with line numbers for easier debugging.
